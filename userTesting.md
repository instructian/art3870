Design Communication Testing

Usability is defined by 5 quality components:

**Learnability**: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?

**Efficiency**: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?

**Memorability**: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?

**Errors**: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?

**Satisfaction**: How pleasant is it to use the design

1. Do a 5-second test for using clue app - http://www.clueapp.com/ to see what people remember. Use this example to guide your questions. https://usabilityhub.com/tests/851a8d01ae4b/results/b69f5d7b4657

2. Ask you subjects to tell you what they see.  Use the [brand worksheet](https://github.com/instructian/art3870/blob/master/definition.pdf) and see if they use the same words to describe the project as you used to design the project.

3. Develop a series of simple tastks that you ask the user to perform and observe how they do them.  Tell them to articulate their actions verbally. For example - "Tell me how you would make a reservation using this site on your phone"  - I would click on the contact link and scroll to the phone number - if is a link and so i will click on the link to see if it opens the dialer.

4. Create a shared 3-column document logging what you observe, what you think it means and what you might do to address the situation
